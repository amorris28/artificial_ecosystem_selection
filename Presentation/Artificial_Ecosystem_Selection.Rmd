## What I'm hoping to get out of this

- Feedback and criticism on questions and experimental design
- Identifying any pitfalls: In 6 months what will I be thinking "Dang, I wish I had done that."?
- Your ideas about how to think about the results I might get
- Statistical approaches to analyzing the results


## Overarching Question

- How do the members of a microbial community relate to the functions their ecosystem exhibits?

- How can we use genetic information to understand ecosystem function?

- What members of the community are statisticaly correlated with a particular function?

- Why might those taxa be controlling function?



## Approaches to structure-function studies

>     - Sample a natural gradient in process rate and compare the communities along that gradient.
> - **Manipulative approach**
>     - Alter the microbial community by testing specific combinations of microbes.
>     - Label the substrate and measure the community that incorporates the label (SIP, BrdU).
> - **Experimental approach**

- Sampling along a natural gradient imposes a problem of covariation with other aspects of the environmet.
- By incubating replicate communities under virtually identical conditions and selecting for the particular function of interest 
- Randomization at the community level breaks the association between confounding variables and our explanatory variables of interest.
- Plus, replication across multiple lines could potentially break up correlations between taxa that are unrelated to the process

Swenson, W., J. Arendt, and D. S. Wilson. 2000. Artificial selection of microbial ecosystems for 3-chloroaniline biodegradation. Environmental Microbiology 2:564–571.

- Create many replicate communities with variation in the microbiota
- Measure the function you're selecting on
- Take the top performers and use them to inoculate the next generation
- Variation is introduced through bottlenecks or subsampling effects on the community
- Akin to a quantitative genetics study where you would take backcross F1s to see what variation in the genome is correlated with variation in a quantitative trait


# Examples of Artificial Ecosystem Selection

## Artificial Ecosystem Selection

- Selected on plant biomass in soil and pH in aquatic microbiota
- Did not look at the microbes
- Found samples separated by soil nutrients (NH4+) (1st Discriminate function)
- Circles are controls, triangles are selected

```

Swenson, W., D. S. Wilson, and R. Elias. 2000. Artificial ecosystem selection. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 97:9110–9114.


- High/low plant biomass
- Two transmission rates: 0.6 g and 6.0 g
- High/low aquatic pH


## Selection on soil microbiomes reveals reproducible impacts on plant function

- Selected on early/late flowering time
- Found reproducible effect on multiple species
- Found no differences in nutrients, but nitrogen enzyme activity was greater
- They did not test the effect of nitrogen additions

## The actual study

No immigration and (assuming) speciation will be negligible.
Control should be entirely drift (and selection for surviving passage).
Experimental should be drift + selection (experimental drift = control drift).

### I expect changes in the community to be:

1. Changes in relative abundance of taxa
2. Changes in intraspecific variation in traits

### Why replicate lines?
1. Potential to separate correlations between taxa that are unrelated to oxidation rates
2. Reproducibility in selection: do the same taxa respond?

##

### Control
One line with neutral selection (random reps inoculate the next gen)

## Pilot Study

```{r, fig.align='center'}

```


## Things to test with a pilot study

- Is there a response to selection?
- What transmssion rate is sufficient to see a response to selection?
- Do selection on forest and wetland soils result in different responses/communities? 
    - i.e. To what extent does the initial community impact the response to selection?

## Plan

- Soils from West Eugene Wetlands
- 8 bottles per line
- 4 lines
- Each line with different transmission rate (0.1%, 1%, 10%)
- 1 control line
- Maybe a follow-up with 1 transmission rate and separate Wetland/Forest lines to see whether source affects the response to selection


# Analysis

## Detecting a significant change in oxidation rates

- ANOVA to compare individual lines with control
- Repeated Measures ANOVA if I want to incorporate all generations in this test
- Power analysis with $\alpha$ = 0.05, power = 1 - $\beta$ = 0.8, and n = 8 suggests I would need to see a 75% increase in oxidation rates in the experimental line over the control line to detect an effect.

## Community analysis

- Differentially abundant taxa
