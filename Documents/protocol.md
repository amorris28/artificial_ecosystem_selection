### Things I would like to determine with preliminary experiments
- What transmission rate balances fidelity (heritability) with variation between generations?
  - 1, 5, 10% by volume? This could be one experiment.
  - Inoculating at 2 or 3 transmission rates helps to test the tradeoff between heritability and introducing genetic variation (i.e. R=h^2S).
- How many replicate lines are needed to break up spurious correlations?
  - I think we decided, arbitrarily, on 3 lines based on logistical limitations
- At what concentration to incubate? i.e. high affinity versus low-affinity
  - I'm not sure it makes sense to incubate upland samples at wetland concentrations, although maybe the signal would be stronger (i.e. higher oxidation rates) at higher methane concentrations
- What is a reasonable number of replicates across all variables to measure flux?
  - Reps x Lines x Transmission rates x Processes x High vs. Low
  - 10 reps, 3 lines, with just one process and transmission rate and only select for high oxidation would result in 30 bottles with a minimum of 90 gas measurements per generation.
- How many and what kind of ecoystems to sample from?
  - Forests seem to have the greatest oxidation rates and variation
- Does the mixing ratio of different source soils matter or can they be homogenized in equal proportions?
  - When homogenizing, combine top 3 samples in varying proportions:
    - 1:1:1, 1:2:1, 2:1:1, 1:1:2, 2:2:1, 1:2:2, 2:1:2
- Measure site-specific fluxes before homogenizing?
  - Homogenization before first incubation or incubate individual sites first to get site-specific flux measurements coupled with marker gene sequences?
- Decide among three generation proportions
  1. Homogenization: Select top 3 bottles, homogenize them, use homogenized material to inoculate all 9 bottles. (Or combine the three top ones in different proportions )
  2. Inbreeding: Select top 3 bottles, use each bottle to inoculate 3 bottles in the next generations
  3. Gene Flow: Inbreed, but introduce external variation every few generations by adding inoculum from another sample
  4. Hybrid: Inbreeding with crossing every few generations

### Oxidation rates from temperate ecosystems

Temperate forests represent ecosystems with some of the highest methane oxidation rates as well as the greatest variation in methane oxidation. And conversion of forest to agriculture generally results in a ⅔ decrease in methane oxidation rates (Smith et al. 2000, GCB). Therefore, I will focus on forest sites to sample the greatest variation in methane oxidation rates.

#### Smith et al. 2000 GCB: Northern Europe
- All ecosystems were sinks (except high water table) 1-200 ug/m2/h1
- natural to agricultural conversions decreased oxidation rates
- Annual rates: 0.1-9.1 kg CH4 ha-1 y-1 with log-normal distribution (log-mean: 1.6 kg/ha/y)
- In general, forests had the highest oxidation rates and grasslands/ag had the lowest

#### Meyer et al. 2018: Gabon
- __Grassland:__ 2.8 +/- 0.3 µmol C m-2 d-1
- __Plantation:__ 4.5 +/- 0.7 µmol C m-2 d-1
- __Forest:__ 2.7 +/- 0.7 or 2.1 +/- 0.5 µmol C m-2 d-1

#### Tate 2007: New Zealand
- __Pine:__ 26 +/- 3.1 ug/m2/h1
- __Pasture:__ 6 +/- 1.5 ug/m2/h1


### How many and what kinds of ecosystems to sample from?
#### What is the population you want to extrapolate to?
- multiple forest ecosystems - Highest methane oxidation rates
- multiple forest and grassland ecosystems - Greater variation in methane oxidation and community
- one forest ecosystem - Lower variation in community, possible equal or lower variation in methane oxidation

## Protocol
1. Collect soil cores (5 cm) from target ecosystems
1. Homogenize environmental samples OR inoculate first generation with unhomogenized samples
2. Inoculate replicate (n = 10) sterile media at 1, 5, or 10% v/v (or w/w) and incubate for 3 weeks (maybe? Based on Howard et al. 2017) to ensure colonization of the microcosm.
3. Incubate under high (1000 ppm) and/or low (5 ppm) methane concentration (or just choose one - perhaps ambient) and measure change in methane concentration.
4. Extract DNA from this first generation for later marker gene sequencing
5. Select the top ~10% of reps within each transmission group, homogenize samples, and use to inoculate the next generation of 10 microcosms at the same rate (1, 5, 10%).
Repeat for ~10 generations or until there’s significant divergence.
6. Extract DNA from the final generation of each line

### Logistical questions:
- Where do I get soil or potting mix from? Better to use natural soil or artificial mix?
- How do I sterilize (autoclave)?
- What methane analyzers are available (from Scott, Lucas, etc.) GC with FID? Or lased-based spec?
- What space can I use? (bench, bottles, septa, incubator)
- Where do I get methane gas standards?
- Vials? Syringes? Needles?
