# Protocol: Artificial Ecosystem Selection Pilot Study

###  Andrew Morris

### Things I would like to determine with this first experiment
These could potentially be answered with multiple experiments to minimize astronomical amounts of replication.
- What transmission rate balances fidelity (heritability) with variation between generations?
  - 1, 5, 10% by volume? This could be one experiment.
- How many replicate lines are needed to break up spurious correlations?
  - 3? This could be done with a power analysis.
- What is a reasonable number of replicates across all variables to measure flux?
  - Reps x Lines x Transmission rates x Processes x High vs. Low
  - 10 reps, 3 lines, with just one process and transmission rate and only select for high oxidation would result in 30 bottles with a minimum of 90 gas measurements per generation.
- How many and what kind of ecoystems to sample from?
  - Forests seem to have the greatest oxidation rates and variation
- Does the mixing ratio of different source soils matter or can they be homogenized in equal proportions?
  - Bill expressed concerns about this, but I feel like microbial communities are sufficiently heterogeneous that it won't matter whether you mix samples 50:50 or 60:40.

### Oxidation rates from temperate ecosystems

Temperate forests represent ecosystems with some of the highest methane oxidation rates as well as the greatest variation in methane oxidation. And conversion of forest to agriculture generally results in a ⅔ decrease in methane oxidation rates (Smith et al. 2000, GCB). Therefore, I will focus on forest sites to sample the greatest variation in methane oxidation rates.

#### Smith et al. 2000 GCB: Northern Europe
- All ecosystems were sinks (except high water table) 1-200 ug/m2/h1
- natural to agricultural conversions decreased oxidation rates
- Annual rates: 0.1-9.1 kg CH4 ha-1 y-1 with log-normal distribution (log-mean: 1.6 kg/ha/y)
- In general, forests had the highest oxidation rates and grasslands/ag had the lowest

#### Meyer et al. 2018: Gabon
- __Grassland:__ 2.8 +/- 0.3 µmol C m-2 d-1
- __Plantation:__ 4.5 +/- 0.7 µmol C m-2 d-1
- __Forest:__ 2.7 +/- 0.7 or 2.1 +/- 0.5 µmol C m-2 d-1

#### Tate 2007: New Zealand
- __Pine:__ 26 +/- 3.1 ug/m2/h1
- __Pasture:__ 6 +/- 1.5 ug/m2/h1


### How many and what kinds of ecosystems to sample from?
#### What is the population you want to extrapolate to?
- multiple forest ecosystems - Highest methane oxidation rates
- multiple forest and grassland ecosystems - Greater variation in methane oxidation and community
- one forest ecosystem - Lower variation in community, possible equal or lower variation in methane oxidation

Measure site-specific fluxes before homogenizing?
Homogenization before first incubation or incubate individual sites first to get site-specific flux measurements coupled with marker gene sequences?

## Protocol
1. Collect soil cores (5 cm) from target ecosystems
1. Homogenize environmental samples OR inoculate first generation with unhomogenized samples
2. Inoculate replicate (n = 10) sterile media at 1, 5, and/or 10% v/v (or w/w) and incubate for 3 weeks (?) to ensure colonization of the microcosm. Inoculating at 2 or 3 transmission rates helps to test the tradeoff between heritability and genetic variation.
3. Incubate under high (1000 ppm) and/or low (5 ppm) methane concentration (or just choose one - perhaps ambient) and measure change in methane concentration.
4. Extract DNA from this first generation for later marker gene sequencing
5. Select the top ~10% of reps within each transmission group, homogenize samples, and use to inoculate the next generation of 10 microcosms at the same rate (1, 5, 10%).
Repeat for ~10 generations or until there’s significant divergence.
6. Extract DNA from the final generation of each line
What is a reasonable number of replicates?
Each replicate will have a vial, possibly 3 or 4 gas measurements taken,
So far that is 30 or 60 replicates per generation. What is a reasonable number? At 30 reps that’s minimum 90 vials of methane to run on the GC.

### General questions:
- Where do I get soil or potting mix from?
- How do I sterilize (autoclave)?
- What methane analyzers are available (from Scott, Lucas, etc.) GC with FID? Or lased-based spec?
- What space can I use? (bench, bottles, septa, incubator)
- Where do I get methane gas standards?
- Vials? Syringes? Needles?
