Notably, the Neutral selection treatment displayed a negative heritability of `r myround(coefficients(herit_model)[2], 2)`. Negative heritability estimates can arise in artificial selection experiments. One explanation for this phenomenon is that traits that are favored under the experimental conditions are negatively correlated with the trait under selection. In this experiment, CH~4~ oxidation rate could be negatively correlated with traits that favor persistence in jars [@conner2003]. This tradeoff would result in a negative heritability because, in the absence of an imposed selection pressure, passaging in jars would favor microbes with lower CH4 oxidation rates.
