>> Single cleanup =

* Add 0.8 x 25 uL = 20 UL omega beads to each PCR reaction, mix well, sit for 5 mins at room temp, then place on magnet until clear

* Aspirate and DISCARD supernatant (containing unwanted small
fragments)

* Add 150 UL 80% ethanol while on magnet, let sit 30 secs at room temp, then aspirate the wash (repeat this step for a total of 2 washes)

* Remove any remaining droplets of ethanol

* Allow to air dry for 2 minutes

* Add 25 UL Elution Buffer, mix well to resuspend beads, sit for 3 mins at room temp, then place on magnet until clear

* Aspirate and TRANSFER clear supernatant (containing eluted amplicons)
to new plate

>> This entire cleanup process is repeated twice on each sample, thus
>> the "double cleanup."
